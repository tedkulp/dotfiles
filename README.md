# Ted's dotfiles

I'm just getting started with this, so it's in a very, very alpha state.
It uses [yadm](https://yadm.io/docs/install), so install that first.

## Directions

* Install yadm
* yadm clone https://github.com/tedkulp/dotfiles
  * Make sure to run bootstrap when it asks
* More stuff to come
